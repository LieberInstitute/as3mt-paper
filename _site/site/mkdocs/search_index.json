Here, we show that risk alleles spanning multiple genes across the 10q24.32 schizophrenia locus are associated in human brain selectively with increased expression of both \nBORCS7\n and a previously uncharacterized human-specific \nAS3MT\n isoform (\nAS3MT\nd2d3\n) that lacks arsenic methyltransferase activity and is more abundant in individuals with schizophrenia than in controls. Conditional expression analysis suggests that the \nBORCS7\n and \nAS3MT\nd2d3\n signals are largely independent. GWAS risk SNPs across this region are linked with a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the first exon of \nAS3MT\n which is associated with expression of \nAS3MT\nd2d3\n in both Caucasian and African American samples. The VNTR genotype predicts activity in luciferase assays and DNA methylation within the \nAS3MT\n gene. Both AS3MT\nd2d3\n and \nBORCS7\n are expressed in adult human neurons and astrocytes and are upregulated during human stem cell differentiation toward neuronal fates. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the prominent 10q24.32 locus association, including a novel and evolutionarily recent protein involved in early brain development and risk for psychiatric illness.\n\n\nLinks",
