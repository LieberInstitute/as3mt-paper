Here, we show that risk alleles spanning multiple genes across the 10q24.32 schizophrenia locus are associated in human brain selectively with increased expression of both BORCS7 and a previously uncharacterized human-specific AS3MT isoform (AS3MT<sup>d2d3</sup>) that lacks arsenic methyltransferase activity and is more abundant in individuals with schizophrenia than in controls. Conditional expression analysis suggests that the BORCS7 and AS3MT<sup>d2d3</sup> signals are largely independent. GWAS risk SNPs across this region are linked with a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the first exon of AS3MT which is associated with expression of AS3MT<sup>d2d3</sup> in both Caucasian and African American samples. The VNTR genotype predicts activity in luciferase assays and DNA methylation within the AS3MT gene. Both AS3MT<sup>d2d3</sup> and BORCS7 are expressed in adult human neurons and astrocytes and are upregulated during human stem cell differentiation toward neuronal fates. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the prominent 10q24.32 locus association, including a novel and evolutionarily recent protein involved in early brain development and risk for psychiatric illness.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
